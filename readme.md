    ```
    git clone git@github.com:arumals/vagrant-lamp.git project-name
    cd project-name
    rm -rf .git
    ```

6. A new mysql `root` user with a `root` password is ready to be use (phpadmin is installed over [http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin](http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin)).
7. A new mailcatcher instance is accesible in [http://localhost:2525](http://localhost:2525) you can redirect your smtp traffic there using these settings inside the code of your project.
    ```
    smtp: 127.0.0.1
    port: 1025
    ```
